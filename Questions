length = input ("Enter side lengths: ")
#in order to compare, the numbers need to be seperated into individual components first. 
a=length[0]
b=length[2]
c=length[4]
#need to determine if all values are equal
if a == b == c:
     print ("The triangle is an equilateral triangle.")
else:
    print ("Sadly, the triangle is not equilateral. Find a better triangle.")

#question, this works as long as the input is integers <10. How do I seperate by space so I can compare values >9? eg input 1230 1230 24
